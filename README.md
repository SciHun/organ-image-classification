ðŸ§  Organ Tissue Classification with CNN | PyTorch Project


I collaborated on this study with my final-term pharmacy student, ðŸ”¬Hamet Peltek. He actively contributed by writing code, performing data cleaning, and assisting with model assessments using JupyterLab.
 
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Python and PyTorch to classify seven different human tissue types: brain, liver, heart, uterus, ovary, kidney, and lung.

ðŸ“Š The dataset consists of 355 histopathological images collected from open-access scientific journals.
The model was trained and validated on labeled data, and it performs with high accuracy, even when tested on unseen images outside the training/validation set.

ðŸ”¬ This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in biomedical image classification.
All the code, visualizations (AUROC curves, class confidence plots), and results are available on my GitHub page.
